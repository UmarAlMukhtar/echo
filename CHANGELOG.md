## 2026-10-24T16:45:00+00:00 — ECHO vertical slice: core game

- Changed: Implemented the full playable vertical slice of *ECHO: The City That Remembers* — Next.js 15 + React Three Fiber app with a procedural low-poly canal district, third-person player (WASD + drag orbit camera + collision), three NPCs, the memory-relay alignment puzzle, three consequential decisions with immediate world transformations, three endings with recap, versioned localStorage save/resume, guided story mode, pause menu, and reduced-motion support. Added a vitest suite for narrative flow, puzzle correctness, decision/ending rules, save validation, and reset. Added DESIGN.md and rewrote README.md for the game (DevDay-era RULES.md/AGENTS.md preserved as scaffold provenance).
- Why: Build the Track 4 "MAKE ROOM FOR PLAY" vertical slice specified in the implementation brief.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck` clean, `npx eslint .` clean (0 problems), `npx vitest run` 28/28 passing, `npm run build` successful.
- Limitations: No audio; browser playthrough verification pending.

## Template setup — 10 October 2026

- Changed: Added the event README, rules, agent guide, change log, AI usage record, submission checklist, Git ignore rules, and pull request checklist.
- Why: Give participants a consistent starting point for event rules, basic coding patterns, documented changes, and regular commits.
- Validation: Checked local Markdown links, event detail consistency, required documents, and diff whitespace before publishing.
- Limitations: Documentation scaffolding only; no participant project, application, or working demo is included. GitHub publication and template status are verified separately after creation.
